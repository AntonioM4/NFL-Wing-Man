## Motativation
-Our motativation was all the years that our teams have been bottom of the division and all the hate we had to put up with. We were tired of not having any facts to rebuttle our attackers with.
## Why
-We built this project to help future fans of historically unforunate teams. We never want another fan to be in a sitatuion where they cannot fight back with stats
## What problem does it solve?
-This app solves the issue of users having no stats to back up what arguments they are using. 
## What did we learn
-Technologies we learned were React.js. We learned how to properly build a single page application.
